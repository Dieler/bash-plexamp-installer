# PlexAmp-installer for Raspberry Pi with armv7l HW.

This is based on the "Raspberry Pi OS Lite" image.<br />
It has been tested on the "2020-08-20-raspios-buster-armhf-lite" and "2020-12-02-raspios-buster-armhf-lite" image.<br />
It should also work on the "DietPi_RPi-ARMv6-Buster" image, but cannot be guaranteed.<br />

This script will install NodeJS 9, configure HiFiBerry-HAT if you choose to, or set HDMI-as default for audio out, and installs Plexamp-v2.0.0-rPi-beta.2.
Plexamp will then runb headless on the Raspberry Pi.
It can be controlled with a Plexamp client on another device, like your smartphone or desktop computer.

The soundcard (PiFi Digi+) used for testing:<br /> https://www.fasttech.com/p/5137000

More info on the card:<br /> https://www.nielsmayer.com/xwiki/bin/view/Raspberry+Pi/Kodi+Audio+Heaven+With+PiFi+Digi+SPDIF+HAT+and+External+DAC

Alternative budget (PiFi DAC+) card:<br /> https://www.fasttech.com/p/5136900

Optional, not part of script:<br />
Both of these PiFi-cards come with IR-sensor that works with lirc. However, there's GPIO conflicts by default.<br />
To disable/remove conflict: in /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf, add:<br />
`blacklist lirc_rpi`<br />
To enable: in /boot/config.txt, for Wheezy and older, add:<br />
`dtoverlay=lirc-rpi,gpio_in_pin=26`<br />
To enable: in /boot/config.txt, for Jesse and newer, add:<br />
`dtoverlay=lirc-rpi:gpio_in_pin=26`<br />

## Burning the image.
Burn the OS-image to the Micro-SD card using etcher (or app of your choice).

## Enable SSH.
How to enable SSH:<br />
For security reasons, as of the November 2016 release, Raspbian has the SSH server disabled by default. You will have to enable it manually.
1. Mount your SD card on your computer.
2. Create or copy a file called ssh in /boot. 
On most Linux-distros, after re-mount of micro-SD-card, run: "touch /media/$user/boot/ssh".
On MacOS, after re-mount of micro-SD-card, run: "touch /Volumes/boot/ssh".

Then unmount and insert card into Raspberry Pi and boot it.

SSH access on "Raspberry Pi OS": User/pass: pi/raspberry<br />
SSH access on "DietPi OS": User/pass: root/dietpi<br />

After SSH-ing to the SBC, on the "Raspberry Pi OS", change to root ("sudo -i") and run script with:

```bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odinb/bash-plexamp-installer/main/install_Plexamp_pi.sh)```


=====================================

To get working server:
You will need to copy the token to "/home/MyUser/.config/Plexamp/server.json".
Optionally you can edit it with your custom values during install.
This file can currently only be extracted from a running installation of an older version of PlexAmp v1.x.x for MacOS/Windows.

On MacOS, the token is located under: "/System/Volumes/Data/Users/MyUser/Library/Application Support/Plexamp/server.json" after logging in.
On Windows, the token is located under: "c:\Users\MyUser\AppData\Local\Plexamp\server.json" after logging in.
Please remember to substitute MyUser for your actual username!

The installer-files can still be found for MacOs at: https://plexamp.plex.tv/plexamp.plex.tv/Plexamp-1.1.0.dmg
For Windows at: https://plexamp.plex.tv/plexamp.plex.tv/Plexamp%20Setup%201.1.0.exe

After adding/updating with your name/identifier/id/token, restart the PlexAmp service with command: "systemctl restart plexamp".
Once done, you can cast to it from existing Plex/PlexAmp instances!

Please remember, you need to remove/delete the Plexamp folder from your MacOS/Windows installation,
or you will get weird behaviour, and end up with a non-functioning PlexAmp due to 2 or more clients using the same ID/tokens!

If the service (systemctl status plexamp) is not starting with error: "code=exited, status=1/FAILURE",
it is most likely due to invalid configuration in "/home/MyUser/.config/Plexamp/server.json"
Fix the errors in the "server.json" file, and restart the service ("systemctl restart plexamp").

=====================================

The script can be re-run to fix configuration/setup errors, just say no/bypass the sections you do not want to re-run!

For hostname-change, please make sure to reboot inbetween, or you might face issues.
